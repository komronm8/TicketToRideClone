## Playing the Game

### Choosing the starting destination cards

cards he wants and then press the button on the bottom right.

### Showing the cards
To cycle through the hand cards, the arrows besides the destination and wagon cards can be used. By pressing the 
"Show Cards" button the other players cards can be looked at. To return to your own cards, press the 
"Show your own cards" button in the bottom.

### Drawing wagon cards

can be chosen. After choosing the first card, it is no longer possible to perform any action besides drawing a second
card.

### Drawing destination cards

shown of which at least one has to be chosen by clicking on it. To confirm the selection, click on the button on the 
bottom right.

cycle through the cards with the arrow buttons. After choosing the cards, click on the route. When it is not possible
to claim the route with the selected cards, an error message will be displayed and another route or different cards 
can be selected.
For tunnels, after the initial selection, a prompt will appear asking for 0 to 3 additional cards. They can be chosen
and then confirmed by pressing the button on the bottom right.
